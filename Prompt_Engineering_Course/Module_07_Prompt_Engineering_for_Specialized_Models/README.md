# Module 07: Prompt Engineering for Specialized Models

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completing this module, you will be able to:

*   Understand the nuances of prompting different LLM architectures (e.g., OpenAI, Google, Anthropic).
*   Utilize custom instructions and fine-tuning concepts to tailor model behavior.
*   Gain a foundational understanding of prompting multimodal models (text-to-image, text-to-audio, etc.).

## Prerequisites

*   Completion of Module 06: Evaluating Prompts and Outputs.
*   A strong grasp of advanced prompting techniques and evaluation methodologies.

## Usage Instructions

1.  Read `notes.md` to explore how prompt engineering adapts to different LLM providers and specialized model types.
2.  Work through the exercises in the `exercises/` directory to practice prompting various models and understanding their unique characteristics.

## Module Content

*   `notes.md`: Detailed explanations of model-specific prompting, custom instructions, fine-tuning, and multimodal prompting.
*   `exercises/specialized_model_prompts_exercises.md`: Hands-on exercises for prompting different LLMs and multimodal models.
