# Module 08: Ethical Considerations in Prompt Engineering - Exercises

These exercises will help you develop the critical skills needed to identify, analyze, and mitigate ethical issues in prompt engineering. Each exercise focuses on practical scenarios that require thoughtful consideration of fairness, safety, and responsibility.

## Exercise 1: Bias Detection and Mitigation

### Task 1.1: Identifying Demographic Bias

Analyze these prompts and their potential outputs for demographic bias:

**Prompt A:** "Generate a list of common professions for men and women."

**Prompt B:** "Create a character profile for a software engineer."

**Prompt C:** "Write a story about a family from a low-income neighborhood."

**Your Analysis:**
```
Prompt A - Potential Biases: [Describe potential stereotypes and imbalances]
Mitigation Strategy: [How would you rewrite the prompt to be more inclusive?]

Prompt B - Potential Biases: [Describe potential stereotypes and imbalances]
Mitigation Strategy: [How would you rewrite the prompt to be more inclusive?]

Prompt C - Potential Biases: [Describe potential stereotypes and imbalances]
Mitigation Strategy: [How would you rewrite the prompt to be more inclusive?]
```

**Example Solution for Prompt A:**
```
Potential Biases: May reinforce gender stereotypes by associating specific professions with men or women. Could underrepresent gender diversity in various fields.

Mitigation Strategy: "Generate a list of diverse professions and discuss how people of all genders contribute to these fields. Avoid generalizations and focus on skills and responsibilities rather than gender roles."
```

### Task 1.2: Cultural Bias Assessment

Evaluate this prompt for potential cultural bias:

**Prompt:** "Describe a typical holiday celebration."

**Your Analysis:**
```
Potential Cultural Biases: [Describe how this prompt might favor certain cultural perspectives]

Mitigation Strategy: [How would you rewrite the prompt to be more culturally inclusive?]
```

## Exercise 2: Responsible AI in Practice

### Task 2.1: Ethical Risk Assessment

Conduct an ethical risk assessment for this application concept:

**Application:** An AI-powered mental health support chatbot for teenagers.

5. [Risk name]: [Description and potential harm]
```

**Mitigation Strategies:**
```
[For each risk, propose specific mitigation strategies]
```

**Example Solution:**
```
Risk 1: Providing Inaccurate Medical Advice
Description: The chatbot could provide incorrect or harmful advice about mental health conditions, leading to negative health outcomes.
