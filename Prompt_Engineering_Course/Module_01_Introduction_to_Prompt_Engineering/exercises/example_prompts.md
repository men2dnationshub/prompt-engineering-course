# Module 01: Introduction to Prompt Engineering - Example Prompts

This file contains simple example prompts to help you get started with interacting with a Large Language Model (LLM). The goal is to demonstrate basic interaction and the concept of providing instructions.

## How to Use These Prompts

1.  Copy the prompt text.
2.  Paste it into your chosen LLM interface (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude).
3.  Observe the LLM's response.
4.  Experiment by slightly modifying the prompts to see how the output changes.

### Example 1: Simple Question

**Prompt:**
```
What is the capital of France?
```

**Expected Output (or similar):**
```
The capital of France is Paris.
```

**Experiment:** Try asking about the capital of another country.

### Example 2: Simple Instruction

**Prompt:**
```
Write a short poem about a cat.
```

**Expected Output (or similar):**
```
A furry friend, with eyes so green,
Leaps and pounces, a playful scene.
Softest purr, a gentle sound,
My lovely cat, all around.
```

**Experiment:** Ask for a poem about a dog, or a different animal.

### Example 3: Summarization

**Prompt:**
```
Summarize the following text in one sentence:

Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence—perceiving, synthesizing, and inferring information—demonstrated by machines, as opposed to intelligence displayed by animals or humans. Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals. Some of the most well-known applications of AI include self-driving cars, facial recognition systems, and natural language processing tools like virtual assistants.
```

**Expected Output (or similar):**
```
Artificial intelligence is the study of intelligent agents that perceive their environment and take actions to achieve goals, with applications like self-driving cars and natural language processing.
```

**Experiment:** Provide a different paragraph of text and ask the LLM to summarize it.

### Example 4: Role-Playing (Basic)

**Prompt:**
```
Act as a friendly customer service representative. How can I help you today?
```

**Expected Output (or similar):**
```
Hello! Thank you for contacting us. How may I assist you today?
```

**Experiment:** Try a different role, like 


a wise old wizard or a curious child.

Remember, the key is to experiment and observe how the LLM responds to different types of instructions. This will build your intuition for effective prompt engineering.
